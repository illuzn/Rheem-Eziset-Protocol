# Unofficial Rheem Eziset Protocol Documentation

![Rheem Eziset Kit](device.png)

These pages seek to document the Rheem Eziset Protocol. 

The Rheem Eziset is a device used to control the hotwater temperatures of certain Rheem Hot Water Systems. This device appears to be a local variant only available in Australia for now.

The device is made available to trades via trade wholesalers. Residential customers may purchase these devices from plumbing wholesalers by *implying* that they are a tradesman and quoting the following Rheem Product/ Part Code: `052310`. The trade price is around AU$300 but your results may vary.

Please note that while Rheem officially calls this device the Rheem EZiSET Kit - wholesalers have listed this device under various other names. The author purchased this device under the `Rheem Smartec Communicator` name.
